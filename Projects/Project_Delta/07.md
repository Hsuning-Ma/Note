Project_Delta ideas
===

About the project, some ideas merged:
  1. $N_p=1$, $N_\pi^0\ge 1$, record all combinations;
  2. $N_p=1$, $N_\bar{p}=1$, $N_\pi^0\ge 1$, record all combinations;
  3. $N_p=1$, $N_\bar{p}=1$, $N_\pi^0\ge 1$, keep the miminum $\chi^2$ combinations;
  4. exclusive reconstruction;
  5. use the inclusive MC of $J/\psi$ as a reference to determine the backgrounds.

Idea 1 has a bad Signal-to-noise ratio. Idea 2 has a bad background. Idea 3 has low efficiencies. While idea 4 has not been test, but according to the situation when test idea 3, the efficiencies will be lower.

How to continue the project is a problem.
