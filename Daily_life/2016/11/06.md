Note of 2016.11.06
====

Last night, I had some missions in the game of **SimCity BuildIt**. And it's a late night. I didn't fall asleep until 4 o'clock. And I planned to prepare my talk in the soon coming BESIII Collaboration Meeting, to make a shopping list and to make a tag list for my **MarkDown** note system.

I woke up at about half past eleven, and go to my office around 2 in the afternoon. The games took me.

And the guys who went to Fenghuangling returned from their tours.

After dinner, I went to shopping with the companion of Jiang Xingyu.
