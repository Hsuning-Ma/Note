Today, I woke up at 08:30. Then go to my office at half past nine.

In the afternoon, I was looking for a cloud note book application which I can use on my Ubuntu.
But after several trials, I found that [EVERNOTE](www.evernote.com) don't have a official Linux client.
A alternative is [geeknote](www.geeknote.me).
But I cannot create notes with complex contents in them.

[WizNote](www.wiz.cn) is a good choice.
However, I don't like the console.
And I love vim, which I cannot use with WizNote.

When I browse some web sites to find a solution, I caught a glimpse of some guy using markdown with [GitHub](www.github.com) as his note book.

I think GitHub is not a good tool as personal note book, because of open source.
So I choose [BitBucket](bitbucket.org), on which I can create private projects.

After some efforts, I successfully create a project named [Note](https://Hsuning_Ma@bitbucket.org/Hsuning_Ma/note.git).
What an achievement.
